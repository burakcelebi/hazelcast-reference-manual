## Deploying On Amazon EC2

You can deploy your Hazelcast project onto an Amazon EC2 environment using Third Party tools such as <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com" target="_blank">Vagrant</a> and <a href="https://www.chef.io/chef/" target="_blank">Chef</a>.

You can find a sample deployment project (`amazon-ec2-vagrant-chef`) with step-by-step instructions in the `hazelcast-integration` folder of the **hazelcast-code-samples** package, which you can download at <a href="https://hazelcast.org/download/" target="_blank">hazelcast.org</a>. Please refer to this sample project for more information.
