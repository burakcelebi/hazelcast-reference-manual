### Split-Brain Protection for Queue

Queues can be configured to check for a minimum number of available members before applying queue operations (see [Split-Brain Protection](#split-brain-protection)). This is a check to avoid performing successful queue operations on all parts of a cluster during a network partition. 

Following is a list of methods that now support Split-Brain Protection checks. The list is grouped by quorum type.

- WRITE, READ_WRITE
    - `Collection.addAll()`
    - `Collection.removeAll()`, `Collection.retainAll()`
    - `BlockingQueue.offer()`, `BlockingQueue.add()`, `BlockingQueue.put()`
    - `BlockingQueue.drainTo()`
    - `IQueue.poll()`, `Queue.remove()`, `IQueue.take()`
    - `BlockingQueue.remove()`
- READ, READ_WRITE
    - `Collection.clear()`
    - `Collection.containsAll()`, `BlockingQueue.contains()`
    - `Collection.isEmpty()`
    - `Collection.iterator()`, `Collection.toArray()`
    - `Queue.peek()`, `Queue.element()`
    - `Collection.size()`
    - `BlockingQueue.remainingCapacity()`
