### Selecting Members for Task Execution

As previously mentioned, it is possible to indicate where in the Hazelcast cluster the `Runnable` or `Callable` is executed. Usually you execute these in the cluster based on the location of a key or a set of keys, or you allow Hazelcast to select a member.

If you want more control over where your code runs, use the `MemberSelector` interface. For example, you may want certain tasks to run only on certain members, or you may wish to implement some form of custom load balancing regime.  The `MemberSelector` is an interface that you can implement and then provide to the `IExecutorService` when you submit or execute.

The `select(Member)` method is called for every available member in the cluster. Implement this method to decide if the member is going to be used or not.

In a simple example shown below, we select the cluster members based on the presence of an attribute.

```java
public class MyMemberSelector implements MemberSelector {
    public boolean select(Member member) {
        return Boolean.TRUE.equals(member.getBooleanAttribute("my.special.executor"));
    }
}
```

You can use `MemberSelector` instances provided by the `com.hazelcast.cluster.memberselector.MemberSelectors` class. For example, you can select a lite member for running a task using `com.hazelcast.cluster.memberselector.MemberSelectors#LITE_MEMBER_SELECTOR`.



### Configuring Executor Service

The following are example configurations for executor service.

**Declarative:**

```xml
<executor-service name="exec">
   <pool-size>1</pool-size>
   <queue-capacity>10</queue-capacity>
   <statistics-enabled>true</statistics-enabled>
   <quorum-ref>quorumname</quorum-ref>
</executor-service>
```

**Programmatic:**

```java
Config config = new Config();
ExecutorConfig executorConfig = config.getExecutorConfig("exec");
executorConfig.setPoolSize( 1 ).setQueueCapacity( 10 )
          .setStatisticsEnabled( true )
          .setQuorumName( "quorumname" );
```

Executor service configuration has the following elements.

- `pool-size`: The number of executor threads per Member for the Executor. By default, Executor is configured to have 16 threads in the pool. You can change that with this element.
- `queue-capacity`: Executor's task queue capacity; the number of tasks this queue can hold.
- `statistics-enabled`: You can retrieve some statistics (such as pending operations count, started operations count, completed operations count, and cancelled operations count) by setting this parameter's value to `true`. The method for retrieving the statistics is `getLocalExecutorStats()`.
- `quorum-ref`: Name of quorum configuration that you want this Executor Service to use. Please see the [Split-Brain Protection for IExecutorService section](#split-brain-protection-for-iexecutorservice).
