Hazelcast provides distributed second level cache for your Hibernate entities, collections and queries. This feature is offered as Hazelcast plugins. We have two plugin repositories for Hibernate 2nd Level Cache. Please see their own GitHub repositories at <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-hibernate" target="_blank">Hazelcast Hibernate</a> (for Hibernate 3.x and 4.x) and <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-hibernate5" target="_blank">Hazelcast Hibernate 5</a> (for Hibernate 5.x) for information on configuring and using them.
