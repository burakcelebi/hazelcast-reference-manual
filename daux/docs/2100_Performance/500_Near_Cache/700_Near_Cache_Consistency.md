#### Eventual Consistency

Near Caches are invalidated by invalidation events. Invalidation events can be lost due to the fire-and-forget fashion of eventing system. If an event is lost, reads from Near Cache can indefinitely be stale.

To solve this problem, starting with Hazelcast 3.8, Hazelcast provides eventually consistent behavior for IMap/JCache Near Caches by detecting invalidation losses.
After detection of an invalidation loss, stale data will be made unreachable and Near Cache's `get` calls to that data will be directed to underlying IMap/JCache to fetch the fresh data.

You can configure eventual consistency with the system properties below (same properties are valid for both member and client side Near Caches):

- `hazelcast.invalidation.max.tolerated.miss.count`: Default value is 10. If missed invalidation count is bigger than this value, relevant cached data will be made unreachable. 
- `hazelcast.invalidation.reconciliation.interval.seconds`: Default value is 60 seconds. This is a periodic task that scans cluster members periodically to compare generated invalidation events with the received ones from Near Cache.

#### Locally Initiated Changes

For local invalidations, when a record is updated/removed, future reads will see this update/remove to provide read-your-writes consistency. To achieve this consistency, Near Cache configuration provides two update policies:

- `INVALIDATE`
- `CACHE_ON_UPDATE`

If you choose `INVALIDATE`, the entry is removed from the Near Cache after the update/remove occurs in the underlying data structure, and before the operation (get) returns to the caller. Until the update/remove operation completes, the entry's old value can still be read from the Near Cache.

If you choose `CACHE_ON_UPDATE`, the entry is updated after the update/remove occurs in the underlying data structure and before the operation (put/get) returns to the caller. If it is an update operation, it will remove the entry and the new value will be placed. Until the update/remove operation completes, the entry's old value can still be read from the Near Cache. Any threads reading the key after this point will read the new entry. If the mutative operation was a remove, the key will no longer exist in the the Near Cache and the original copy in the member.
