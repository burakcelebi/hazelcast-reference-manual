Assume that you have an "employee" map containing values of `Employee` objects, as coded below.


```java
import java.io.Serializable;

public class Employee implements Serializable {
  private String name;
  private int age;
  private boolean active;
  private double salary;

  public Employee(String name, int age, boolean active, double salary) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
    this.active = active;
    this.salary = salary;
  }

  public Employee() {
  }

  public String getName() {
    return name;
  }

  public int getAge() {
    return age;
  }

  public double getSalary() {
    return salary;
  }

  public boolean isActive() {
    return active;
  }
}
```


Now let's look for the employees who are active and have an age less than 30 using the aforementioned APIs (Criteria API and Distributed SQL Query). The following subsections describe each query mechanism for this example.

![image](../../images/NoteSmall.jpg)***NOTE:*** *When using Portable objects, if one field of an object exists on one member but does not exist on another one, Hazelcast does not throw an unknown field exception.
Instead, Hazelcast treats that predicate, which tries to perform a query on an unknown field, as an always false predicate.*
