Hazelcast provides extension methods to Cache API through the interface `com.hazelcast.cache.ICache`.

It has two sets of extensions:

* Asynchronous version of all cache operations. See [Async Operations](#icache-async-methods).
* Cache operations with custom `ExpiryPolicy` parameter to apply on that specific operation. See [Custom ExpiryPolicy](#defining-a-custom-expirypolicy).

![Note](../../images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *ICache data structure can also be used by [Hazelcast Jet](https://jet.hazelcast.org/) for Real-Time Stream Processing (by enabling the Event Journal on your cache) and Fast Batch Processing. Hazelcast Jet uses ICache as a source (reads data from ICache) and as a sink (writes data to ICache). Please see the [Fast Batch Processing](https://jet.hazelcast.org/use-cases/fast-batch-processing/) and [Real-Time Stream Processing](https://jet.hazelcast.org/use-cases/real-time-stream-processing/) use cases for Hazelcast Jet.*

*Please also see [here](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/jet/0.5/manual/Work_with_Jet/Source_and_Sink_Connectors/Hazelcast_IMDG.html#page_IMap+and+ICache) in the Hazelcast Jet Reference Manual to learn how Jet uses ICache, i.e., how it can read from and write to ICache.*

### Scoping to Join Cluster

A `CacheManager`, started either as a client or as an embedded member, can be configured to start a new Hazelcast instance or reuse an already existing one to connect to a Hazelcast cluster. To achieve this, request
a `CacheManager` by passing a `java.net.URI` instance to `CachingProvider::getCacheManager`. The `java.net.URI` instance must point to either a Hazelcast configuration or to the name of a named
`com.hazelcast.core.HazelcastInstance` instance. In addition to the above, the same can be achieved by passing Hazelcast-specific properties to `CachingProvider::getCacheManager(URI, ClassLoader, Properties)` as detailed in the sections that follow.

<br></br>
![image](../../images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *Multiple requests for the same `java.net.URI` result in returning a `CacheManager`
instance that shares the same `HazelcastInstance` as the `CacheManager` returned by the previous call.*
<br></br>

#### Examples

The following examples illustrate how `HazelcastInstance`s are created or reused during the creation of a new `CacheManager`. Complete reference on the `HazelcastInstance` lookup mechanism is provided in the sections that follow.

##### Starting the Default `CacheManager`

Assuming no other `HazelcastInstance` exists in the same JVM, the `cacheManager` below will start a new `HazelcastInstance`, configured according to the configuration lookup rules as defined for `Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance()` in case of an embedded member or `HazelcastClient.newHazelcastClient()` for a client-side `CacheManager`.

```java
CachingProvider caching = Caching.getCachingProvider();
CacheManager cacheManager = caching.getCacheManager();
```

##### Reusing Existing `HazelcastInstance` with the Default `CacheManager`

When using both Hazelcast-specific features and JCache, a `HazelcastInstance` might be already available to your JCache configuration. By configuring an instance name in `hazelcast.xml` in the classpath root, the `CacheManager` will locate the existing instance by name and reuse it.

- `hazelcast.xml`:
  
  ```xml
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
  <hazelcast xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.hazelcast.com/schema/config hazelcast-config-3.9.xsd" xmlns="http://www.hazelcast.com/schema/config" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
      <instance-name>hz-member-1</instance-name>
  </hazelcast>
  ```
  
- `HazelcastInstance` & `CacheManager` startup:
  
  ```java
  // start hazelcast, configured with default hazelcast.xml 
  HazelcastInstance hz = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();
  // start the default CacheManager -- it will locate the default hazelcast.xml configuration
  // and identify the existing HazelcastInstance by its name
  CachingProvider caching = Caching.getCachingProvider();
  CacheManager cacheManager = caching.getCacheManager();
  ```
 
##### Starting a `CacheManager` with a New `HazelcastInstance` Configured with a Non-default Configuration File

Given a configuration file named `hazelcast-jcache.xml` in the package `com.domain`, a `CacheManager` can be configured to start a new `HazelcastInstance`:

- By passing the `URI` to the configuration file as the `CacheManager`'s `URI`:
 
  ```java
  CachingProvider caching = Caching.getCachingProvider();
  CacheManager cacheManager = caching.getCacheManager(new URI("classpath:com/domain/hazelcast-jcache.xml"), null);
  ```

- By specifying the configuration file location as a property:

  ```java
  Properties properties = HazelcastCachingProvider.propertiesByLocation("classpath:com/domain/aaa-hazelcast.xml");
  CachingProvider caching = Caching.getCachingProvider();
  CacheManager cacheManager = caching.getCacheManager(new URI("any-uri-will-do"), null, properties);
  ```

Note that if the Hazelcast configuration file does specify an instance name, then any `CacheManager`s referencing the same configuration file will locate by name and reuse the same `HazelcastInstance`.

##### Reusing an Existing Named `HazelcastInstance`

Assuming a `HazelcastInstance` named `hc-instance` is already started, it can be used as the `HazelcastInstance` to back a `CacheManager`:
 
- By using the instance's name as the `CacheManager`'s `URI`:

  ```java
  CachingProvider caching = Caching.getCachingProvider();
  CacheManager cacheManager = caching.getCacheManager(new URI("hc-instance"), null);
  ```
 
- By specifying the instance name as a property:

  ```java
  Properties properties = HazelcastCachingProvider.propertiesByInstanceName("hc-instance");
  CachingProvider caching = Caching.getCachingProvider();
  CacheManager cacheManager = caching.getCacheManager(new URI("any-uri-will-do"), null, properties);
  ```


#### Applying Configuration Scope

To connect or join different clusters, apply a configuration scope to the `CacheManager`. If the same `URI` is
used to request a `CacheManager` that was created previously, those `CacheManager`s share the same underlying `HazelcastInstance`.

To apply configuration scope you can do either one of the following:

- pass the path to the configuration file using the location property
`HazelcastCachingProvider#HAZELCAST_CONFIG_LOCATION` (which resolves to `hazelcast.config.location`) as a mapping inside a
`java.util.Properties` instance to the `CachingProvider#getCacheManager(uri, classLoader, properties)` call.
- use directly the configuration path as the `CacheManager`'s `URI`.

If both `HazelcastCachingProvider#HAZELCAST_CONFIG_LOCATION` property is set and the `CacheManager` `URI` resolves to a valid config file location, then the property value will be used to obtain the configuration for the `HazelcastInstance` the first time a `CacheManager` is created for the given `URI`.
 
Here is an example of using configuration scope:

```java
CachingProvider cachingProvider = Caching.getCachingProvider();

// Create Properties instance pointing to a Hazelcast config file
Properties properties = new Properties();
// "scope-hazelcast.xml" resides in package com.domain.config
properties.setProperty( HazelcastCachingProvider.HAZELCAST_CONFIG_LOCATION,
    "classpath:com/domain/config/scoped-hazelcast.xml" );

URI cacheManagerName = new URI( "my-cache-manager" );
CacheManager cacheManager = cachingProvider
    .getCacheManager( cacheManagerName, null, properties );
```

Here is an example using `HazelcastCachingProvider::propertiesByLocation` helper method:

```java
CachingProvider cachingProvider = Caching.getCachingProvider();

// Create Properties instance pointing to a Hazelcast config file in root package
String configFile = "classpath:scoped-hazelcast.xml";
Properties properties = HazelcastCachingProvider
    .propertiesByLocation( configFile );

URI cacheManagerName = new URI( "my-cache-manager" );
CacheManager cacheManager = cachingProvider
    .getCacheManager( cacheManagerName, null, properties );
```

The retrieved `CacheManager` is scoped to use the `HazelcastInstance` that was just created and configured using the given XML
configuration file.

Available protocols for config file URL include `classpath` to point to a classpath location, `file` to point to a filesystem
location, and `http` and `https` for remote web locations. In addition, everything that does not specify a protocol is recognized
as a placeholder that can be configured using a system property.

```java
String configFile = "my-placeholder";
Properties properties = HazelcastCachingProvider
    .propertiesByLocation( configFile );
```

You can set this on the command line:

```plain
-Dmy-placeholder=classpath:my-configs/scoped-hazelcast.xml
```

You should consider the following rules about the Hazelcast instance name when you specify the configuration file location using `HazelcastCachingProvider#HAZELCAST_CONFIG_LOCATION` (which resolves to `hazelcast.config.location`):

* If you also specified the `HazelcastCachingProvider#HAZELCAST_INSTANCE_NAME` (which resolves to `hazelcast.instance.name`) property, this property is used as the instance name even though you configured the instance name in the configuration file.
* If you do not specify `HazelcastCachingProvider#HAZELCAST_INSTANCE_NAME` but you configure the instance name in the configuration file using the element `<instance-name>`, this element's value will be used as the instance name.
* If you do not specify an instance name via property or in the configuration file, the URL of the configuration file location is used as the instance name.


<br></br>
![image](../../images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *No check is performed to prevent creating multiple `CacheManager`s with the same cluster
configuration on different configuration files. If the same cluster is referred from different configuration files, multiple
cluster members or clients are created.*

![image](../../images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *The configuration file location will not be a part of the resulting identity of the
`CacheManager`. An attempt to create a `CacheManager` with a different set of properties but an already used name will result in
undefined behavior.*
<br></br>

#### Binding to a Named Instance

You can bind `CacheManager` to an existing and named `HazelcastInstance` instance. If the `instanceName` is specified in `com.hazelcast.config.Config`, it can be used directly by passing it to `CachingProvider` implementation. Otherwise (`instanceName` not set or instance is a client instance) you must get the instance name from the `HazelcastInstance` instance via the `String getName()` method to pass the `CachingProvider` implementation. Please note that `instanceName` is not configurable for the client side `HazelcastInstance` instance and is auto-generated by using group name (if it is specified). In general, `String getName()` method over `HazelcastInstance` is safer and the preferable way to get the name of the instance. Multiple `CacheManager`s created using an equal `java.net.URI` will share the same `HazelcastInstance`.

A named scope is applied nearly the same way as the configuration scope. Pass the instance name using:

- either the property `HazelcastCachingProvider#HAZELCAST_INSTANCE_NAME` (which resolves to `hazelcast.instance.name`) as a mapping inside a `java.util.Properties` instance to the `CachingProvider#getCacheManager(uri, classLoader, properties)` call.
- or use the instance name when specifying the `CacheManager`'s `URI`.

If a valid instance name is provided both as property and as `URI`, then the property value takes precedence and is used to resolve the `HazelcastInstance` the first time a `CacheManager` is created for the given `URI`.

Here is an example of Named Instance Scope with specified name:

```java
Config config = new Config();
config.setInstanceName( "my-named-hazelcast-instance" );
// Create a named HazelcastInstance
Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance( config );

CachingProvider cachingProvider = Caching.getCachingProvider();

// Create Properties instance pointing to a named HazelcastInstance
Properties properties = new Properties();
properties.setProperty( HazelcastCachingProvider.HAZELCAST_INSTANCE_NAME,
     "my-named-hazelcast-instance" );

URI cacheManagerName = new URI( "my-cache-manager" );
CacheManager cacheManager = cachingProvider
    .getCacheManager( cacheManagerName, null, properties );
```

Here is an example of Named Instance Scope with specified name passed as `URI` of the `CacheManager`:

```java
Config config = new Config();
config.setInstanceName( "my-named-hazelcast-instance" );
// Create a named HazelcastInstance
Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance( config );

CachingProvider cachingProvider = Caching.getCachingProvider();
URI cacheManagerName = new URI( "my-named-hazelcast-instance" );
CacheManager cacheManager = cachingProvider
    .getCacheManager( cacheManagerName, null);
```

Here is an example of Named Instance Scope with auto-generated name:

```java
Config config = new Config();
// Create a auto-generated named HazelcastInstance
HazelcastInstance instance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance( config );
String instanceName = instance.getName();

CachingProvider cachingProvider = Caching.getCachingProvider();

// Create Properties instance pointing to a named HazelcastInstance
Properties properties = new Properties();
properties.setProperty( HazelcastCachingProvider.HAZELCAST_INSTANCE_NAME, 
     instanceName );

URI cacheManagerName = new URI( "my-cache-manager" );
CacheManager cacheManager = cachingProvider
    .getCacheManager( cacheManagerName, null, properties );
```

Here is an example of Named Instance Scope with auto-generated name on client instance:

```java
ClientConfig clientConfig = new ClientConfig();
ClientNetworkConfig networkConfig = clientConfig.getNetworkConfig();
networkConfig.addAddress("127.0.0.1", "127.0.0.2");

// Create a client side HazelcastInstance
HazelcastInstance instance = HazelcastClient.newHazelcastClient( clientConfig );
String instanceName = instance.getName();

CachingProvider cachingProvider = Caching.getCachingProvider();

// Create Properties instance pointing to a named HazelcastInstance
Properties properties = new Properties();
properties.setProperty( HazelcastCachingProvider.HAZELCAST_INSTANCE_NAME, 
     instanceName );

URI cacheManagerName = new URI( "my-cache-manager" );
CacheManager cacheManager = cachingProvider
    .getCacheManager( cacheManagerName, null, properties );
```

Here is an example using `HazelcastCachingProvider::propertiesByInstanceName` method:

```java
Config config = new Config();
config.setInstanceName( "my-named-hazelcast-instance" );
// Create a named HazelcastInstance
Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance( config );

CachingProvider cachingProvider = Caching.getCachingProvider();

// Create Properties instance pointing to a named HazelcastInstance
Properties properties = HazelcastCachingProvider
    .propertiesByInstanceName( "my-named-hazelcast-instance" );

URI cacheManagerName = new URI( "my-cache-manager" );
CacheManager cacheManager = cachingProvider
    .getCacheManager( cacheManagerName, null, properties );
```

<br></br>
![image](../../images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *The `instanceName` will not be a part of the resulting identity of the `CacheManager`.
An attempt to create a `CacheManager` with a different set of properties but an already used name will result in undefined behavior.*
<br></br>

#### Binding to an Existing Hazelcast Instance Object

When an existing `HazelcastInstance` object is available, it can be passed to the `CacheManager` by setting the property `HazelcastCachingProvider#HAZELCAST_INSTANCE_ITSELF`:

```java
// Create a member HazelcastInstance
HazelcastInstance instance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();

Properties properties = new Properties();
properties.put( HazelcastCachingProvider.HAZELCAST_INSTANCE_ITSELF, 
     instance );

CachingProvider cachingProvider = Caching.getCachingProvider();
// cacheManager initialized for uri will be bound to instance
CacheManager cacheManager = cachingProvider.getCacheManager(uri, classLoader, properties);
```
