During the restart process, each member waits to load data until all the members in the partition table are started. During this process, no operations are allowed. Once all cluster members are started, Hazelcast changes the cluster state to `PASSIVE` and starts to load data. When all data is loaded, Hazelcast changes the cluster state to its previous known state before shutdown and starts to accept the operations which are allowed by the restored cluster state.

If a member fails to either start, join the cluster in time (within the timeout), or load its data, then that member will be terminated immediately. After the problems causing the failure are fixed, that member can be restarted. If the cluster start cannot be completed in time, then all members will fail to start. Please refer to the [Configuring Hot Restart section](/13_Storage/02_Hot_Restart_Persistence/04_Configuring_Hot_Restart.md) for defining timeouts.

In the case of a restart after a cluster crash, the Hot Restart feature realizes that it was not a clean shutdown and Hazelcast tries to restart the cluster with the last saved data following the process explained above. In some cases, specifically when the cluster crashes while it has an ongoing partition migration process, currently it is not possible to restore the last saved state.

#### Example Scenarios

Assume the following:

- You have a cluster consisting of members A, B and C with Hot Restart enabled, which is initially stable.
- Member B is killed.
- Member B restarts.

Since only a single member has failed, the cluster performed the standard High Availability routine by recovering member B's data from backups and redistributing the data among the remaining members (the members A and B in this case). Member B's persisted Hot Restart data is completely irrelevant.

Furthermore, when a member starts with existing Hot Restart data, it expects to find itself within a cluster that has been shut down as a whole and is now restarting as a whole. Since the reality is that the cluster has been running all along, member B's persisted cluster state does not match the actual state. Therefore, member B aborts initialization and shuts down.

As another scenario, assume the following:

- You have a cluster consisting of members A, B and C with Hot Restart enabled, which is initially stable.
- Member B is killed.
- Member B's Hot Restart [base directory (`base-dir`)](/13_Storage/02_Hot_Restart_Persistence/04_Configuring_Hot_Restart.md) must be deleted.
- Member B restarts.

Now member B joins the cluster as a fresh, empty member. The cluster will assign some partitions to it, unrelated to the partitions it owned before going down.
